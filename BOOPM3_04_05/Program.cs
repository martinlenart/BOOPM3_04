	//Exercises:
	//1.	Create and initialize an array of tuples. Iterate over the array and printout some selected items using tuple pattern in a switch
	//		construct.
	//2.	Create an array of objects and initialize it with various tuples types. Iterate over the array with switch construct using type pattern.
	//		Recognize some specific tuple types and printout result
